## Objectives and Outcomes

This course seeks to advance studentsâ€™ programming
knowledge and experience in multiple directions:
a new language and paradigm; increased programming
problem size and complexity; and more
rigorous testing and validation. This focus on programming
advancement intrinsically involves a laboratory
environment, apprenticeship-style training,
and increased adherence to process and form.
Long after the course concludes, my hope is that
you will be able to:
  1. Design, compile, and test programs within a command-line environment.
  2. Correctly solve medium-sized programming problems.
  3. Follow academic and technic
